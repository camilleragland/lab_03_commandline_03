==========
16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------
cd books/other
ls
pg1232.txt
cat pg1232.txt

==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
head pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince


==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------

 tail pg1232.txt

==========
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
	less pg1232.txt
	more pg1232.txt
	space bar goes through text 
	q returns to command line 

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
less - shows the beginning of file 
more - shows the whole text 
cat - shows all context of file 
tail - end of file 
head - beginning of file 


==========
21.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?
----------
wc pg1232.txt
5063(line) 52639(words) 305864(characters) pg1232.txt


==========
22.  How many lines are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the line count?
----------
wc -l pg1232.txt
	 5063 pg1232.txt
